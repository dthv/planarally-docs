PlanarAlly has come a long way and while I still have a ton of stuff planned, it was time to take a look at the documentation and communication of PlanarAlly news.

Although the old documentation system over at readthedocs did its work, it was pretty lacking in multiple regards.
Something I would like to improve upon with this reboot is the ease for contributors to help on the documentation.

Another nice addition is that by using the excellent gridsome framework I can more easily change and add things to this site compared to the purely documentation focussed readthedocs.

A first addition is the thing you're reading right now, a blog!  The idea is that I use this avenue to make more detailled posts about new releases as well as some progression updates or other news updates :\)

I've had a lot of contributions to the codebase from various users, for which I'm very grateful, so expect a new release somewhere soon \(TM\)
