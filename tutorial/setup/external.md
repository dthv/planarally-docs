# External Services

By far the easiest option regarding setup is the use of an online service that provides PlanarAlly to you and your players.

At this point in time I do not have the resources to publicly host a PlanarAlly server, but this might be something I would like to add further down the road.

#### WARNING

Important to know is that these services are **not** operated by me and thus I cannot guarantee that the software has not been altered with malicious intentions.

## Known providers

At the time of writing only [dndbox](https://planarally.dndbox.com/) is known to me to offer PlanarAlly as a public service.  If you host or know someone who hosts PA publicly, feel free to let me know!
