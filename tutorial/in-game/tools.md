# Tools

Your prime interaction with the game board is through the usage of the various tools.
Most of these tools can be found in the lower right corner of the screen in the toolbar, but some are located in different places.

The tools shown will differ depending on your role in the game (e.g. DM vs player) and some tools may only become active if relevant (e.g. filter/vision).

For a detailled overview of what each tool does, you should check the [tools documentation](/docs/tools/select/).

As a simple overview I'm going to divide the tools in a subset of 3 big categories. Tools that are primarily used for moving around the game, tools used for adding things to the game and tools that offer general utilities.

## Navigation Tools

A big chunk of the tools is dedicated to moving around the game board.

The [select tool](/docs/tools/select/) is used to select/move/resize the various game pieces.
Next to it on the toolbar is the [pan tool](/docs/tools/pan/) which allows you to pan across the game board, to reach places you otherwise couldn't see.

The [zoom tool](/docs/tools/zoom/) allows you to change the zoom level. This tool can be found in the topright.

The other tool not on the toolbar is only visible depending on context. It's the floor tool, located on the bottom left. It is always visible to the DM, but only visible to players when there actually are multiple floors. This tool can be used by the DM to increase immersion by layering floors on top of eachother.

Additionally next to the floor tool, the [layers](/docs/dm/layers/) are also visible for the DM. Layers provide the DM with yet another mechanism to improve immersion and usability, by separating the map, tokens and lighting in a logical structure.

## Creation Tools

Adding things to the board is possible in three different ways.

You can draw your own shapes using predifined forms or in freeform using the [draw tool](/docs/tools/draw/). This is useful for drawing vision borders (e.g. declaring where walls are) or for some impromptu map design.

As a DM you can drag an asset you uploaded to the asset manager from the asset menu to the board. This is the go to way for adding rich visual maps and tokens to your game.

The last option is accessed by right-clicking an empty location on the board and selecting the `create token` option. This allows you to quickly define a circular token with some text in the center. This is useful if you quickly need to add an npc to the game that has no specific artwork associated with it.

## Utility Tools

The vast majority of tools are non-essential, but do offer some nice utilities.

The [ping tool](/docs/tools/ping/) offers an easy way to alert other players of something you want to highlight and the [ruler](/docs/tools/ruler/) is an easy way to quickly measure distances.

The DM has three more tools in his toolbox: [map](/docs/tools/map/), [vision](/docs/tools/vision/) and [filter](/docs/tools/filter/).
For info on how these tools work, check their specific documentation.
