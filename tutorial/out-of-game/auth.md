# Authentication

The first page you're greeted with when you visit PlanarAlly is the Login/Registration form, as you likely do not have an account yet, you can choose a username and password and press the (+) button.

Currently no email address is required for sign-up, which means that there is no solid recovery mechanism in case you lose your password, so make sure you don't lose it ;)

_! There is no single PlanarAlly website. This means that an account you create only exists on that particular server. Someone else hosting PlanarAlly will not have your account._
