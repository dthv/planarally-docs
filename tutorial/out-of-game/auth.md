# Authentication

The first page you're greeted with when you visit PlanarAlly is the Login/Registration form, as you likely do not have an account yet, you can choose a username and password and press the (+) button.
If you already have an account, you can log-in with your credentials, pressing the <font-awesome :icon="['fas', 'arrow-right']"/>-button.

Currently no email address is required for sign-up, which means that there is no solid recovery mechanism in case you lose your password, so make sure you don't lose it ;) that said it is technically possible for the passwords to be changed by a [server administrator](/docs/server/management). That said there is no automated system so your results may vary.

_! Any account created is unique to that specific PlanarAlly site and will not exist yet (or even be occupied) on another PlanarAlly site._

With the drop-down menu below the password field, you can change the language of the user-interface to any language that is currently supported.
Note that PlanarAlly is developed in english and, thus, in case a translation of something in the user-interface is missing, the english version of the string will be displayed.
