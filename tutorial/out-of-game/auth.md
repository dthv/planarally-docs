# Authentication

The first page you're greeted with when you visit PlanarAlly is the Login/Registration form, as you likely do not have an account yet, you can choose a username and password and press the (+) button.

Currently no email address is required for sign-up, which means that there is no solid recovery mechanism in case you lose your password, so make sure you don't lose it ;) that said it is technically possible for the passwords to be changed by a [server administrator](/docs/server/management.md). That said there is no automated system so your results may vary.

_! Any account created is unqiue to that specific PlanarAlly site and will not exist yet (or even be occupied) on another PlanarAlly site._
