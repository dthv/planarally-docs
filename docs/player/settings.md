# In-game Settings

The in-game settings are accessed by clicking the <font-awesome :icon="['fas', 'cog']"/>-icon on the upper left screen of your browser window and clicking on *Client Options*.

As a player, there are only a couple of things you can configure in-game that does not involve editing your character settings.

In essence you can configure which colours you desire for your [ruler](/docs/tools/ruler/), the grid and the fog of war.
The opacity slider for the FOW colour is non functional currently, as a DM you can change this in the DM settings.

You can also invert the behaviour of the `ALT`-key (see also the [quick reference](/docs/reference/)):
Normally, pressing `ALT` disables snapping behaviour of the [select](/docs/tools/select/) and the [draw](/docs/tools/draw/) tools.
If inverted, snapping is off by default and toggled by pressing the `ALT`-key.

Last, but not least, you can select another language by choosing one of the supported languages in the drop-down menu.
Note that PlanarAlly is developed in english and, thus, in case a translation of something in the user-interface is missing, the english version of the string will be displayed.
