# In-game Settings

As a player there are only a couple of things you can configure in-game that does not involve editing your character settings.

In essence you can configure which colours you desire for your ruler, the grid and the fog of war.

The opacity slider for the FOW colour is non functional currently, as a DM you can change this in the DM settings.
