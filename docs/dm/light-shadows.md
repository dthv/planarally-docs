# Lighting & Vision

In this section we'll describe how you as a DM can bring more life to your dungeons and provide your players with a dynamic experience!

As the title suggests there are 2 core ideas in PlanarAlly that are responsible for how your players perceive the board state.

By adding lights (or darkness) to some places on the map, you immediately bring more personality to a place, additionally you can place a torch on someone's character and you get an even greater sense of dungeon delving.  Placing lights all over your map however will already spoil some cool locations to your players when they're only at the entrance.  To prevent this the vision of a certain character needs to be taken into account and if we have that we should have a very immersible experience.

We'll first go over some of the lighting setup and will finally discuss how vision works.

## Lighting

There are varying degrees of complexity we can achieve in PlanarAlly and depending on how you want to run your game you'll choose a different method.

There is also 1 DM setting related to lighting called the 'Fill entire canvas with FOW' and this can be found in the Vision tab.  This setting toggles whether the entire screen should be filled with fog by default or not.

### Magical Lights and Darkness

The first kind of lighting is what I call 'magical' lighting because it is so powerful that the magical lights cannot be hidden and the magical darkness can not be pierced by normal lights.

I use this kind of vision rarely as I depend on dynamic vision, but even then it has its usecases.

#### How to use

If you select the draw tool as a DM you'll see a mode toggle at the top.  When this is set to reveal, you'll be drawing magical lights, when set to hide, you'll be drawing magical darkness.

All shapes drawn in reveal or hide mode are automatically drawn on the vision (fow) layer! So if you made a mistake or want to remove something for example, go to the vision layer to fix it!

#### When to use ?

It can happen that you quickly want to show a certain part of the screen to the players, without having to move them all over.  Maybe you want to show the compass on the screen at all times while the entire screen is covered in fog by default.  Or maybe you have a daylight scene with no fog, but want to make sure the contents of a building are not yet revealed until the final showdown.

Another typical usecase is when you as a DM want to grant vision to players as they go, keeping everything they visited visible.  By combining the 'cover everything with fog' option and then drawing with the paintbrush in reveal mode, you can easily paint a path for your players.
