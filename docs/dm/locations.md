# Locations

The Locations Tool provides multiple instances of a set of [layers](/docs/dm/layers/).

## Access
Only the DM can actively access and manipulate Locations.
This is done by clicking on the compass symbol at the upper left corner of the screen.
Players only interact with one map at a time; for them, a new Location looks like a different map (i.e. a different set of stacked layers).
