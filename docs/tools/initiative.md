# Initiative Tracker

The Initiative Tool is a moveable pop-up window that allows you to track the initiative order of various objects (normally tokens).

## Access

The Initiative Tool is not accessible via the toolbar on the lower right of the user interface.
Instead, it is accessed via context-menus.
By right-clicking anywhere on the map, you can always choose to `Show Initiative` in the context-menu, activating the tool.
Also, the context-menu of objects (shapes, assets or tokens) shows the `Show Initiative` option, if the object is already entered into the initiative list.
If the object in question is not (yet) listed in the initiative list, the context-menu will show `Add Initiative`, opening the Initiative Tool and entering the object into the list, at the same time.
