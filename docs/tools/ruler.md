# Ruler Tool

A simple tool that gives you the option to measure distances.

From the place where you clicked a line is drawn with a number showing the distance to your mouse cursor, until you release the mouse.

This is **publicly** visible for all players in the session.

The colour in which this is drawn can be chosen by each player in their client settings.
